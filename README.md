# Dotfiles

These dotfiles are backed with a bare git repository. If you do some internet searches, you'll find out more. The TL;DR - I wanted a simple dotfile setup, so I did some searching and found this to be the best for me.

## Setup
* Download `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeremywrowe/dotfiles/main/setup.sh` to your home directory 
* make `setup.sh` executable in your terminal with `chmod a+x setup.sh`
* run in your terminal `./setup.sh`
* Download `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeremywrowe/dotfiles/main/.zshrc` to your home directory
* open a new shell
